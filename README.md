pytools
=======

just convenient tools, added as I need/write them. written and tested with python 2.7.5 on a mac, but should work on any os.

##folder_flattener.py
drop this file into a folder with many directories of files (for example if you download and extract a ton of census data). open the script and update the function to true if you want to delete source folders, false if you want to keep source folders.
